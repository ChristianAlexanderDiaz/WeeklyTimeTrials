# Mario Kart World Time Trial Bot - Development Documentation

## Overview

This Discord bot manages weekly time trial challenges for Mario Kart World tracks. It was built using pure Python with raw SQL queries (PostgreSQL) for hands-on database learning and production-ready Discord bot development.

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Raw SQL Instead of ORM?

The original plan considered SQLAlchemy, but we chose raw SQL for several key reasons:

1. **Learning SQL for Job Requirements**: The developer needed hands-on SQL experience for a new job role requiring "proficiency with SQL"
2. **Direct Database Skills**: Raw SQL provides direct experience with queries, joins, indexing, and performance optimization
3. **Production Readiness**: Understanding SQL execution and query optimization is crucial for production systems
4. **Transparency**: No hidden query generation or ORM abstractions to debug

### Database Design Philosophy

- **Normalized Schema**: Proper foreign key relationships between trials and times
- **Performance Indexes**: Strategic indexing for common query patterns (leaderboards, user lookups)
- **Data Integrity**: CHECK constraints and proper data types
- **Audit Trail**: Created/updated timestamps for all records

### Time Handling Strategy

- **Storage**: Times stored as milliseconds (INTEGER) for precise comparison
- **Format**: User input/display in MM:SS.mmm format (e.g., "2:23.640")
- **Range**: 0:00.000 to 9:59.999 (realistic Mario Kart times)
- **Validation**: Comprehensive regex validation with clear error messages

### User Name Resolution

Instead of storing usernames in the database (which become stale), we:
- Store only Discord user IDs (permanent)
- Resolve display names dynamically using Discord API
- Handle edge cases (user left server, API errors)
- Cache results during leaderboard generation for performance

## SQL Learning Outcomes

This project provided hands-on experience with:

### DDL (Data Definition Language)
- CREATE TABLE with proper constraints
- ALTER TABLE for schema modifications
- DROP TABLE for cleanup
- INDEX creation for performance

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)
- Complex SELECT queries with joins
- INSERT with RETURNING clause
- UPDATE with conditional logic
- DELETE with CASCADE effects

### Advanced SQL Features
- ROW_NUMBER() for rankings
- CASE statements for medal calculations
- Subqueries for complex filtering
- UPSERT with ON CONFLICT
- Transaction management
- Date/time functions

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic indexing for common queries
- Composite indexes for multi-column searches
- Query execution planning
- Connection pooling

## Discord Bot Implementation

### Command Architecture

Used inheritance-based design with BaseCommand class providing:
- Common error handling
- Database connection management
- Input validation
- Response formatting
- Logging integration

### Autocomplete Strategy

Each command requiring track selection implements smart autocomplete:
- `/save`: Shows only tracks with active trials
- `/leaderboard`: Shows tracks with any trials (historical data)
- `/remove-time`: Shows only tracks where user has submissions
- `/set-challenge`: Prioritizes tracks without active trials
- `/end-challenge`: Shows only tracks with active trials

### Error Handling Hierarchy

1. **Validation Errors**: User input problems (friendly messages)
2. **Command Errors**: Business logic failures (clear explanations)
3. **Database Errors**: Technical issues (generic user message, detailed logging)
4. **Unexpected Errors**: Catch-all with logging for debugging

## Database Schema Deep Dive

### weekly_trials Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE weekly_trials (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    trial_number INTEGER NOT NULL,           -- For "Weekly Time Trial #N"
    track_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,        -- Mario Kart World track
    gold_time_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,           -- Goal times in milliseconds
    silver_time_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
    bronze_time_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
    start_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    end_date TIMESTAMP,                      -- NULL = active forever
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',     -- 'active', 'expired', 'ended'
    guild_id BIGINT NOT NULL,                -- Discord server ID
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- `trial_number` for human-readable naming instead of using database ID
- `status` enum for trial lifecycle management
- `end_date` nullable to support permanent trials if needed
- Composite unique constraint prevents duplicate active trials per track

### player_times Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_times (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    trial_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES weekly_trials(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,                 -- Discord user ID (permanent)
    time_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,                -- Time in milliseconds
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(trial_id, user_id)               -- One time per user per trial
);
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Foreign key with CASCADE DELETE for data integrity
- UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate submissions
- No username storage (resolved dynamically)
- Millisecond precision for accurate time comparison

### Performance Indexes

```sql
-- Leaderboard queries (most frequent)
CREATE INDEX idx_player_times_trial_time ON player_times(trial_id, time_ms);

-- User-specific queries
CREATE INDEX idx_player_times_user_id ON player_times(user_id);

-- Active trial lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_weekly_trials_status_guild ON weekly_trials(status, guild_id);

-- Composite index for admin queries
CREATE INDEX idx_weekly_trials_guild_status_track ON weekly_trials(guild_id, status, track_name);
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Railway Configuration

Chose Railway for deployment because:
- Built-in PostgreSQL provisioning
- Git-based automatic deployments
- Environment variable management
- Persistent storage for database
- Simple scaling options

### Environment Variables

```bash
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname
DEBUG=false
```

### Health Monitoring

- Automatic trial expiration via background tasks
- Database connection health checks
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Time Trial Business Logic

### Trial Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Admin creates trial with `/set-challenge`
   - Validates track not already active
   - Enforces concurrent trial limits
   - Sets goal times and duration

2. **Active Phase**: Users submit times with `/save`
   - Only accepts improvements (faster times)
   - Real-time medal calculation
   - Prevents duplicate submissions

3. **Expiration**: Automatic or manual ending
   - Background task marks expired trials
   - Manual ending via `/end-challenge`
   - Trials become read-only

4. **Cleanup**: Automated removal after grace period
   - 3-day grace period for viewing results
   - Automatic deletion to prevent database bloat

### Medal System

Medal thresholds are set per trial:
- ðŸ¥‡ Gold: time_ms â‰¤ gold_time_ms
- ðŸ¥ˆ Silver: time_ms â‰¤ silver_time_ms
- ðŸ¥‰ Bronze: time_ms â‰¤ bronze_time_ms

Calculated dynamically in SQL queries for real-time accuracy.
